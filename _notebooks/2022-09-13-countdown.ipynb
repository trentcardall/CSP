I realized along the way that it would be really cool if you could choose how long you wanted the timer be instead of just having it a minute long. Using what I learned about loops recently, I realized a while loop can create the function I wanted. However, I ran into multiple problems such as the list counting backwards and the loop never stopping, but after changing parts and a couple internet searches I figured out how to make it work the way I wanted to. You can input any number from 0-60 and it will give you a timer of that long."
