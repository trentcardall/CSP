    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for binary digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?\n",
    "    - 24 bits\n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits? \n",
    "    - Numbers, letters, words\n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",
    "    - Digital storage, it is much more compact and efficient and allows data to be stored in a way that is more simple, at least for a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary.\n",
    "    - 0 = False\n",
    "    - 1 = True\n"

    "2. What base is Hexadecimal? What range of values can each digit of Hexadecimal represent?\n",
    "    - Hexadecimal is base 16, meaning each digit in hexadecimal can represent values from 0 to 15\n",
    "3. When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system?\n",
