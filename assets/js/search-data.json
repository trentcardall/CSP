Legislative Process: Bill must pass by majority of house and 60 votes in the Senate. . | the 2nd Amendment is interpreted differently by conservatives and liberals. Liberals believe limits can be placed on the right to bear arms while conservatives believe it means that gun ownership rights should not be limited. . | Not the only gun law under consideration, Assault Weapons ban passed in House but probably won’t pass in Senate . | Uvalde, Texas school shooting made gun control a big topic of debate in the government. Democrats and Republicans worked together to create a gun control bill which they agreed on called the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BCSA) . | More specifics on background checks so that guns don’t get in the hands of potentially violent people . Juvenile records for under age of 21 . | Keep guns away from people convicted of abuse . | Provides grants to states to implement red flag laws, where people can petition courts to prevent certain people from owning guns. . | . | Although both Republicans and Democrats generally agreed on the passing of this bill, some think it did not do enough and others think it will make it too hard for civilized people to own guns. . | The passing of this bill signifies that the government truly is under pressure from the public and the people still hold the power. Since gun violence was a pressing topic the government worked quickly to address this issue and make some changes to satisfy the public . | . Event: Recession? . National Bureau of Economic Research defines recession as two quarters of economic decline . | Can lead to unemployment, business failures, bankruptcies . | Pandemic and war in Ukraine are affecting aspects of the economy . | Inflation: rise on prices, decline in purchasing power . | Recession≠depression . | US has experienced 2 quarters of decline and inflation . Fits definition, but economists say it does not necessarily indicate recession . | . | Other signs=higher interest rates, dip in stock market . | Strong signs: Low unemployment, good job growth, low debt . | .",

            "content": "-By typing in the tool you want to verify, followed by --version, you can see what version of the tool you install. For example, running python --version will tell you which version of Python you have installed, which is Python 3.9.12 for me. . -You can use Anaconda to verify tools as well. For example running conda list will reveal all the packages and versions which you have installed. Running conda info will verify which version of Anaconda you have installed. . -By using some of the GitHub commands you can update a repository with BASH. There are many commands involving updating a repository, but some of the main ones that would be used are git pull and git commit. I personally think it is much easier to update a repository through VSCode by using git clone and code . to edit in VSCode and then push the changes onto GitHub, which is what I did to make this post. .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
