            "content": "In the cell below, the code creates a &quot;dictionary&quot; where all the data is stored. I decided to define certain things about me to show my understanding of data structures. tesst . InfoDb = [] # Creating keys and values for the data structure InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Trent&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Cardall&quot;, &quot;Class&quot;: &quot;APCSP&quot;, &quot;Date of Birth&quot;: &quot;March 9, 2005&quot;, &quot;Place of Birth&quot;: &quot;Scottsdale, AZ&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Playing music&quot;, &quot;Surfing&quot;, &quot;Playing Lacrosse&quot;] # [] makes ordered list }) print (InfoDb) .

The data structure was printed which shows proof that it works. However, it is not exactly easy for the average person to read. By using other functions we can format the list to make the output more organized. There are multiple ways to pull data out of the structure, but all of them will produce the same output. . For loop . Pulls records one by one out of data structure until there is nothing left . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;-Class:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Class&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;-Date of Birth:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Date of Birth&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;-Place of Birth:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Place of Birth&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;-Hobbies:&quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) def for_loop(): print(&quot;A little about myself:&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() # activating function . A little about myself: Trent Cardall -Class: APCSP -Date of Birth: March 9, 2005 -Place of Birth: Scottsdale, AZ -Hobbies:Playing music, Surfing, Playing Lacrosse . While loop . Counts through the items in the list until record is passed. . def while_loop(): print(&quot;A little about myself:&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i +=1 return while_loop() . A little about myself: Trent Cardall -Class: APCSP -Date of Birth: March 9, 2005 -Place of Birth: Scottsdale, AZ -Hobbies:Playing music, Surfing, Playing Lacrosse . Recursion . Using a function defined as recursive_loop(i), each time data is pulled out it will add a number to i to move on to the next item in the list. Eventually i &lt; len(InfoDb) will be false, and the loop will end . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) print (&quot;A little about myself:&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . A little about myself: Trent Cardall -Class: APCSP -Date of Birth: March 9, 2005 -Place of Birth: Scottsdale, AZ -Hobbies:Playing music, Surfing, Playing Lacrosse . Reverse Order . One of the hacks is to attempt to display the list in reverse order. The first idea that came to mind and seemed easiest was to change the recursive loop so that it subtracts each time, and start it at the highest number of the list. . def reverse_order(i): if i &lt;= len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) reverse_order(i - 1) print(&quot;Reverse order&quot;+&quot; n&quot;) print(&quot;A little about myself:&quot;) reverse_order(6) .

To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
