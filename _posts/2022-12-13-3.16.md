## Notes and Takeaways
- Simulations model real world situations
- Often model complicated situations but remove some of the factors that makes it more complicated
- We do not need to know how to make one because it's very hard but we do need to know:
    - Certain details in simulations are removed as it would make it really complicated for little effect
    - For example, a dice roll is not truly random. There are lots of factors like the angle it is rolled at which effects the roll. However, it is not realistic to simulate this so it is better to use a random number generator which technically is not the same but in reality has the same effect
- Simulation example:
    - Utilizes procedure and iterations
    - Flowcharts
    - Uses all of our main ideas to make the simulation possible
- Simulations used to make predictions of what could happen in certain situations so people can test different methods
- Although they are not perfect, they are accurate enough to give companies/people an idea of what kind of solutions/methods work best
