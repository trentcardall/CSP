## Missed Questions and Review
### Question 14

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mc1.png)

I said that input A could either be true or false, but it must be true. I was a bit confused by the diagram and though it was saying that A could be true or false.

### Question 28

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mc2.png)

This one you had to select multiple. I got one of the algorithms right, but not the other. This was the correct answer:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mc2a.png)

Looking back, this algorithm makes complete sense at the answer, I think I overthought the amount of iterations and thought there were too many and the robot would move too far.

### Question 30

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mc3.png)

This was another one where you had to select multiple, and again I only got one of them right. Here was the correct one which I did not choose:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mc3a.png)

This one makes sense as the center of the circle starts at (4,2), not (4,1), and the radius starts at 1, not 0

### Question 41

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mc4.png)

I said RANDOM (1,10)=2, but it is actually RANDOM (1, 10)â‰¤2, because there is a 20 percent chance it lands on 1 or 2, not just 2.

### Question 44
This question was asking about a bank using a simulation for different waiting methods. I said the bank wouldn't consider other alternatives, as I thought other methods weren't being tested, but it was that they did not have actual results from real customer data.

### Question 45
This was asking when it would be acceptable to use a heuristic approach to solve a problem. I wasn't quite sure what heuristic meant, so I looked it up and it was using trial and error and using loosely defined rules. I decided between two answers, both of which had when an approximate solution was acceptable, but I ended up choosing it can be solved in a reasonable amount of time instead of unreasonable amount of time.
