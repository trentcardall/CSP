Hi! My name is Trent Cardall and I am currently a student in AP Computer Science Principles. I do not know a whole lot about coding right now but I have already learned so much in the short time I have been in this class. I am taking this class because I want to see if I can potentially have a future in computer science, a field that will only get bigger from now on.
