## Submission 1
|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|---|---|---|---|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|0|I gave this student a point because video demonstrated inputting the side lengths of the triangle and it showed output and functionality with the return of the trigonometric values. The written section also specifically described the purpose, functionality, and input/output of the video|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|The student earned a point in this row because the written section showed one code segment of a list with multiple elements and the second showed those elements being used in the program. It also identified variable names and described its purpose in the program|
|Managing Complexity|0|0|The list the student mentioned does not actually manage complexity in the program and does not really make a difference in the work which has to be done.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|The procedure uses multiple parameters, is called later in the program, and has functionality essential to the program.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|Explained the procedure in a lot of detail and how it works and it uses sequencing, selection, and iteration|
|Testing|1|1|Describes the conditions tested by each call and shows results|
