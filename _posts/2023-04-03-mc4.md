## Corrections
### Question 37

n^2 is actually a reasonable amount of steps, I was thinking that it was more. I need to study the topic of space and time more before the AP test.

## Reflection
I am mostly ready but I need to review more space and time since it is a new topic. I also need to review more of the internet stuff because it is not quite as intuitive and I forgot some of the stuff since I first learned it.
