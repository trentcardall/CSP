-By typing in the tool you want to verify, followed by `--version`, you can see what version of the tool you install. For example, running `python --version` will tell you which version of Python you have installed, which is Python 3.9.12 for me.   

-You can use Anaconda to verify tools as well. For example running `conda list` will reveal all the packages and versions which you have installed. Running `conda info` will verify which version of Anaconda you have installed.

-By using some of the GitHub commands you can update a repository with BASH. There are many commands involving updating a repository, but some of the main ones that would be used are `git pull` and `git commit`. I personally think it is much easier to update a repository through VSCode by using `git clone` and `code .` to edit in VSCode and then push the changes onto GitHub, which is what I did to make this post.
