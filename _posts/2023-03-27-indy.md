## Individual Plan for CPT
- Since I am DevOps, I need to make sure I get my part in deployment done fast, as my team will depend on the backend deployment for the functionality of the project. If I procrastinate, the whole team will suffer because of me.
- I also need to prepare my individual part of the lesson on Conda Scripts. I don't know a lot about this yet, so I need to do my research in order to provide the class with the information they need to succeed on the AP test and in this class.

I have made meaningful commits every week since Ski Week.
