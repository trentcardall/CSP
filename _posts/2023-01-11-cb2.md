## Submission 1
|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|---|---|---|---|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|Written responses are a bit vague and do not demonstrate strong understanding of the program purpose, functionality, and is not specific with the input and output.|
|Data Abstraction|0|0|Shows to different lists and does not show how the data within the list is being used in the program. It just shows two different lists which are being used in the program|
|Managing Complexity|0|0|Does not show how the lists are being used to manage complexity in the program. No code is shown which actually implements one of the lists.|
|Procedural Abstraction|0|0|There is a procedure shown which is pretty complicated and it does show it being called. The main problem is that the student does not describe the procedure very well and does not effectively show how it contributes to the functionality of the program.|
|Algorithm Implementation|0|0|The algorithm uses sequencing, selection, and iteration, but is not described in enough detail to where someone else could recreate it.|
|Testing|1|1|Describes conditions which are being tested and identifies results.|

|---|---|---|---|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|Video and written response demonstrate understanding of the purpose, functionality, and input/outputs involved in the program. Answers very specific to the program and relate to the video.|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|Shows the generation of the list and how it is implemented in the program. Also makes sure to point out that the list is referred to by a different name in the function to avoid confusion.|
|Managing Complexity|1|1|The list involved definitely manages complexity, and makes the program a lot simpler than it would've been without the use of the particular list. Describes how the program manages complexity well.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1||Shows a procedure used in the program and also shows where it is being called. The student does a great job describing how the specific procedure contributes to the program and its functionality.|
