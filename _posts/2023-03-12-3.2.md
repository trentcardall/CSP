## Reflection
Although I got 100% on the other two quizzes, I got 2 questions wrong on the Using Programs With Data Quiz. This quiz was a little bit more confusing than the other ones and wasn't quite as straightforward.   

The first question I got wrong on this quiz was a little bit weird but I ended up being stuck between C and D and picked the wrong one.

I thought both of these made sense so I picked one. I see how D is right though as that would be used from the database

The other one I got wrong was another weird question that was a lot of information to take in, so it confused me from the start.

I now realize that C is wrong because it doesn't properly clean out the unavailable information.
