## Example 1

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/example1.png)

This question wasn't too hard, because I have done things involving iteration before, so I knew pretty quickly how I wanted to accomplish this task.

## Example 2

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/example2.png)

This question was harder, and I needed to do some additional research on what a bubble sort was and how to execute one.

## Quiz

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz1.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz2.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz3.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz4.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz5.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz6.png)

I got questions 9 and 10 wrong, which are kind of similar questions. I learned that I need to know what situations for loops are better for and what situations while loops are better for, because I wasn't entirely sure on those questions.

For the lists and iteration in the JS code, instead of having to define each individual answer as correct or incorrect, you can just select an index out of each list to be correct and have all those turn green while the others turn red.
