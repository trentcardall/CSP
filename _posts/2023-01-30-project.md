For the creative performance task, I will use my creation of the car survey and submit the work I did for that.

## Code Plan
- I will make sure that the code utilizes lists which I can show effective abstraction from. I think for this, I create a list of cars and show when they show up/are called as the answer.
- I need to create a procedure which is called in the program. I think I will make one which has to do with the decision process for how cars are selected based on the answers which are chosen.

## Video
In the video, I will take the survey multiple times to show it recommending me different cars based on the answers which I choose.
