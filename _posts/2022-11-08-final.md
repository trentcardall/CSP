## Challenges
Although I got a 50/50, some of the questions took some additional research. Most of the questions I had to put additional research into were the ones involving binary, which I happened to know nearly nothing about. With the help of my table mates, and some additional research, I ended up learning a lot about binary when storing the test and how data is stored, specifically in 4 bits.

### 4 bit binary
|Number|Binary|
|---|---|
|0|0000|
|1|0001|
|2|0010|
|3|0011|
|4|0100|
|5|0101|
|6|0110|
|7|0111|
|8|1000|
|9|1001|
|10|1010|
|11|1011|
|12|1100|
|13|1101|
|14|1110|
|15|1111|

### Other Challenges
Other challenging questions were not necessarily confusing in concept, but required some time to think about the question. For example there were a lot of questions that included lots of swapping of variables. I would have to read it over multiple times to make sure my answer was correct and I got the final alignment of variables right. There were also questions that were very math oriented. Although the level of math was not very complicated, you would have to look over the code multiple times to find out the order of operations being used.

## Takeaways
Overall, I think this shows that I am on good pace for the AP test and I have a good chance of scoring high if I continue on this trend. I still have a long way to go and a lot to learn though.
