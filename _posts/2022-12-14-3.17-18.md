## Notes and Takeaways
- Sometimes algorithms can be written ways that are more efficient saving time and lines of code
- Algorithms can be divided into 4 types
    - 1 step
    - 2 step
    - 3 step
    - 4 step
- First step is integer being multiplied by a variable "n". 
- Two step is integer to the power of n
- Three step is integer being multiplied by n, all to the power of 2
- Four step is variable factorial (!)
- Linear and square runs in reasonable amount of time, while exponential and factorial run in unreasonable amounts of time
- Reasonable time:
    - n^2
    - 2n
    - n
    - n^10
    - n^20
    - log(n)
- Unreasonable time:
    - 2^n
    - 10^n
    - 5^n
- Decidable problems: Problems where algorithms can be written and solved for the correct output
- Undecidable problems: No algorithms can be built for a correct yes or no answer
- Don't necessarily need to be able to tell if problem is undecidable for now, just need to know that they exist.
