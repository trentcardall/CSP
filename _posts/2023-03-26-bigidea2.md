## Reflection
I did a lot better on this quiz than other quizzes, and I felt like this kind of material regarding data and data compression is pretty self explanatory for the most part. I didn't have to look anything up and I was surprised I ended up getting a 100% without using help from the internet. I find this topic to be a lot easier than some of the other collegeboard topics.
