## Overall Takeaways
- Procedures: named group of programming instructions w/ parameters/return values
    - Also known as function
- Procedure is basically a group of steps which are assigned to accomplish a specific task
    - Ask yourself: What are you trying to accomplish, how will I accomplish that
- Since procedures are named, you can simply just write the name of said procedure to call back to those lines of code

## Prompt #1 (hackathon, I did this one for my group)
PROCEDURE reachGoal()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- ROTATE_LEFT()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- ROTATE_RIGHT()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()
- MOVE_FORWARD()

## Hacks
### 3.12 Part 1
**Problem 1:**
Total Time/Total Distance ​

- Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed.
    - PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) }
    - PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) }
    - <mark>PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) }</mark>

**Problem 2:**
I think it's true that nothing will be displayed as the procedure never tells anything to be displayed. If it said DISPLAY (myEmotion) then something would be displayed

**Problem 3:**
Which of these code snippets successfully calculates and stores her total footprint? Highlight 2 answers.

1. <mark>totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252)</mark>

2. totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118 + 3442, 252)

3. <mark>totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252))</mark>

4. laNyCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) nyLondonCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) totalFootprint ← laNyCarbon + nyLondonCarbon

### 3.12 Part 2:
1. a = 9*81 = 729

2. cost = 1.1*173 = 190 3/10

3. Celsius = 71*5/9 = 39 4/9

### 3.13
1. 
- PROCEDURE replaceRB (toprbyardspg, currentrbyards, totalGames)
    - currentrbyardspg ⟵ currentrbyards / totalGames
    - IF currentrbyardpg > toprbyardspg
        - toprbyardspg⟵currentrbyards

If we were to run this procedure with the numbers listed, toprbyardspg would become 105, as that is the currentrbyardspg

2. PROCEDURE reachGoal():
    - ROTATE_RIGHT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_LEFT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_RIGHT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_LEFT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_LEFT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_RIGHT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_LEFT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()

3. b. PROCEDURE MyList is correct because "procedure" is capitalized but the name of it isn't

4. PROCEDURE reachGoal():
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_LEFT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_RIGHT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - ROTATE_LEFT()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
    - MOVE_FORWARD()
