## 3.1 Video 2:
I did not get any questions wrong, but some of them took me longer than others, especially since I was doing it all in my head. It is hard to keep track of variables, so maybe actually writing down what the variables change to might make it easier. I did learn that it is important to keep track of variables being rearranged and reassigned to make sure that code is working as intended.

### My questions:

c⟵6     
d⟵8      
a⟵d    
b⟵a    
c⟵b    

DISPLAY(a)    
DISPLAY(b)      
DISPLAY(c)

## 3.1 Assignment 1
1. numApples and integer is the best, since it is a numerical value
2. isCold is the best variable, and boolean is the best as it is true or false
3. IDnumber and string is the best. Even though it is a number you are not adding or subtracting from it
4. No, isRaining is better, the other one is way too long.
5. Boolean is best for true or false
6. Integer is to be added or subtracted to. String is for objects or numbers you are not going to be adding or subtracting to.
