## Score

## Question 38

I wasn't entirely sure what IPv6 was, so this was mostly just a guess

## Question 50

II and III did not seem to me like they would run in a reasonable time, but I guess they do.

## Reflection
I just need to keep studying the same topics that I have been struggling with, such as the internet and time complexity.
