## Notes and Takeaways
- Existing code segments can be derived from existing sources
- Libraries can be used to simplify complex programs
    - Libraries are collections of pre-written code or procedures that can be used to maximize efficiency
- Documentation is explaining what the procedure/code does
- random(a, b) returns a random integer between a and b
    - random.choice will pick a random item from a list of strings
    - random.shuffle will shuffle a list
    - randint is random integer
    - randrange picks from a range of numbers which have a certain start value and multiple
- Overall, utilizing libraries such as the random one can make it much easier to code and allow you do more things than you normally would with your code
