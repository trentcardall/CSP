## Notes and Takeaways
- Existing code segments can be derived from existing sources
- Libraries can be used to simplify complex programs
    - Libraries are collections of pre-written code or procedures that can be used to maximize efficiency
- Documentation is explaining what the procedure/code does
- random(a, b) returns a random integer between a and b
    - random.choice will pick a random item from a list of strings
    - random.shuffle will shuffle a list
    - randint is random integer
    - randrange picks from a range of numbers which have a certain start value and multiple
- Overall, utilizing libraries such as the random one can make it much easier to code and allow you do more things than you normally would with your code

### Reflection
I learned the importance of libraries and how to use them, specifically the random function, which you can do a lot more stuff with than I realized. I know there is a lot more libraries which have a lot more functions, and I plan on researching some of them so that I can do a lot more with my code while still keeping it relatively simple.

## Multiple Choice

1. What does the random(a,b) function generate?

    A. A random integer from a to be exclusive

    B. <mark>A random integer from a to b inclusive.</mark>

    C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive.

    D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive.

I chose B because it includes the integers listed and it is not in reference to variables. a and b are just place holders for integers you would put on the list

2. What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)?

    A. <mark>x = start, y = stop, z = step</mark>

    B. x = start, y = step, z = stop

    C. x = stop, y = start, z = step

    D. x = step, y = start, z = stop

I chose A because x and y reference the start and stop of the range you want to pull from and z is the step, or the number you are adding by

3. Which of the following is NOT part of the random library?

    A. <mark>random.item</mark>

    B. random.random

    C. random.shuffle

    D. random.randint

I chose A because all the other ones have particular functions. I initially got "random.item" confused with "random.choice". I also initially thought it was random.random, but I found out that can find a random floating point

## Short Answer Questions
1. What is the advantage of using libraries?
    - It allows us to import code that as already written/developed and can make it a lot easier to code certain algorithms/procedures, as well as allowing us to a lot more with our code

2. Write a thorough documentation of the following code.

```python
import random 

names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, seperated by a comma.")
names = names_string.split(",")

num_items = len(names)

random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1)

person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice]

print(f"{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!")
```

<mark>Documentation:</mark> This code builds a list of names based on the user input and then chooses a random name from the list to decide who is going to pay for the meal.

## Coding Challenges
Jupyter notebooks aren't working with fastpages so I'm just going to show screenshots of my code/outputs

1. Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names

2. Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins

### Extra Credit
I tried my best, but I wasn't sure how to make it completely mutually exclusive so if an obstacle complicated with something else than I just got rid of that obstacle

Here's my illustration using the numbers generated from the code:
