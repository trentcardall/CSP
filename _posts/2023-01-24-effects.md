## Dopamine Issues
As far as dopamine issues go, I think part of it is real but it is being exaggerated by parents. I think a lot of it depends on the person. Some people may be spending too much time on the internet to the point where it is unhealthy and they aren't getting any stimulation from anywhere else. However, I feel like the majority of people, while they may still have some dependence and addiction from the internet, still understand the importance of real life social experiences.

## Pros/Cons of Internet Blockers at School

    - Reduces distractions for kids at school
    - Blocks out material which may not be appropriate for school
- Cons:
    - Sometimes blocks out websites which are necessary for class (AWS)
    - Kids can pretty easily find ways around blockers if they are motivated

## Digital Divide
As far as concerns go, I think a big one is that it furthermore increases the cost of living and basic necessities. Now, in order to be a successful, you need to be able to afford a phone and computer to have any sort of outreach. This makes it even harder for poor people to catch up as they now need to think about several things and may be at a disadvantage if their phones are older and of less quality.

## 5.3 Hacks
I think people don't always realize the control these sites have over groups of people. They can choose to push certain information and ideas over people. I think people should start to realize when they go down certain rabbit holes and take the information they are presented with a grain of salt as it may start to get more and more biased. We should also take other peoples opinions in mind when developing programs so that we can write them in a way that works for a lot of people, not just me.

## 5.4 Hacks
