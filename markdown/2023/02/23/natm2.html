<p>Both Photography and APCSP wanted me to go to Night at the Museum. Originally I was kind of reluctant to go but I ended up having a great time with a lot of my friends there. I had really fun not only presenting my team’s work but looking at the work other students did as well. I also really liked the sort of atmosphere with the band playing outside and also all of the people there. There was a lot more people than what I was expecting.</p>

<p>I walked through the animation section, not really knowing what to expect. I saw all this sort of digital art, which I found cool. I didn’t even know that this was a class offered at our school. I thought some of the student’s work I saw was really cool and I found it to be kind of interesting.</p>

<h2 id="ceramics">
<a class="anchor" href="#ceramics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ceramics</h2>

<p>I also walked around the ceramics room, and was impressed by some of the student’s creations, some of which happened to be from my friends. People say that class is easy but a lot of the pieces in there were actually very impressive and seemed pretty difficult to make.</p>

<h2 id="drawing-and-painting">
<a class="anchor" href="#drawing-and-painting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Drawing and Painting</h2>

<p><img src="/cuddly-succotash/images/dp.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>This probably impressed me the most out of any of the stations. The student’s art was very impressive and far beyond what I could imagine myself doing. I have never been a great drawer or painter.</p>
