<a class="anchor" href="#question-14" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 14</h3>

<p><img src="/cuddly-succotash/images/mc1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I said that input A could either be true or false, but it must be true. I was a bit confused by the diagram and though it was saying that A could be true or false.</p>

<h3 id="question-28">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-28" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 28</h3>

<p><img src="/cuddly-succotash/images/mc2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This one you had to select multiple. I got one of the algorithms right, but not the other. This was the correct answer:</p>

<p><img src="/cuddly-succotash/images/mc2a.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Looking back, this algorithm makes complete sense at the answer, I think I overthought the amount of iterations and thought there were too many and the robot would move too far.</p>

<h3 id="question-30">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-30" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 30</h3>

<p><img src="/cuddly-succotash/images/mc3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This was another one where you had to select multiple, and again I only got one of them right. Here was the correct one which I did not choose:</p>

<p><img src="/cuddly-succotash/images/mc3a.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This one makes sense as the center of the circle starts at (4,2), not (4,1), and the radius starts at 1, not 0</p>

<h3 id="question-41">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-41" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 41</h3>

<p><img src="/cuddly-succotash/images/mc4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I said RANDOM (1,10)=2, but it is actually RANDOM (1, 10)≤2, because there is a 20 percent chance it lands on 1 or 2, not just 2.</p>

<h3 id="question-44">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-44" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 44</h3>
<p>This question was asking about a bank using a simulation for different waiting methods. I said the bank wouldn’t consider other alternatives, as I thought other methods weren’t being tested, but it was that they did not have actual results from real customer data.</p>

<h3 id="question-45">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-45" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 45</h3>
<p>This was asking when it would be acceptable to use a heuristic approach to solve a problem. I wasn’t quite sure what heuristic meant, so I looked it up and it was using trial and error and using loosely defined rules. I decided between two answers, both of which had when an approximate solution was acceptable, but I ended up choosing it can be solved in a reasonable amount of time instead of unreasonable amount of time.</p>
